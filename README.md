## Project Objective :
The objective of this **personal** project is to develop **AI** models that predicting Surf conditions based on weather data.  
This involves Data Mining, Supervised Learning, and Web Application development.

## Key Project Steps :
- **Data Mining** : Text Scraping, Data Analysis, and Formatting to build a large dataset (4GB)
- **Supervised Learning** : Training models using *TensorFlow* and *PyTorch* libraries
- **Web Development** : Setting up server logic (each project branch contains a different implementation of this part) and communication with an API (*OpenWeatherMap*)

## Weather Data :
The weather data collected using *OpenWeatherMap* (and provided to the models) includes: **longitude**, **latitude**, **temperature**, **pressure**, **wind speed**, **wind direction**.  
The value inferred by the models: **wave height**.  
For more information, see the [Data](https://github.com/LugolBis/wAIves/tree/main/DATA) folder.

## Models :
Numerous models have been trained with various parameter variations (epochs, metrics, layers, and datasets).  
These tests have identified the models providing the best results.  
For more information, see the [Models](https://github.com/LugolBis/wAIves/tree/main/Models) folder.
